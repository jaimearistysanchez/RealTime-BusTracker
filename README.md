RealTime-BusTracker

Description of Project

Real Time Bus Tracker shows a map of the city of Cambridge. Once you click a button, it shows you all the stops between MIT and Harvard. 

How to Run:

The project has an html file, which includes a container for the map, as well as a button which when clicked will show the stops between Harvard and MIT. The CSS file just positions the map in the browser. Finally the javascript file includes the bus stops between the two, and a function called move that makes the marker in the map move across the different stops at a pace set by a setTimeout function.  

Roadmap of future improvements

There could be other locations added onto the map. There would be different buttons then that would show you the stops between the different locations.
